# Automated-Remedy-System---Machine-Learning
This project aims at providing the first step of recovery that can be ad- ministered to the patient until the patient can visit the doctor. This is achieved by the use of machine learning to develop a Decision Support System which works by mimicking doctorâ€˜s intuition on analyzing symp- toms and inferring on the type of fever. The application records symptoms of an experienced by a person that will be matched with a set of symptoms, which can result to a certain fever. The data will be provided by appropriate medical practitioner. This application has two interfaces. At the first sign of symptoms, a patient may enter their interface and specify the appropriate symptoms, which will be recorded by a questionnaire. Based on the given information the system will identify the type of fever and suggest a medicinal drug or natural remedy for immediate relief as well as fix an appointment with a doctor closest to the locality of the patient. The prescriptions will be administered with proper dosage which the patient may take or consult doctor before taking them.
